相较于之前view animation的优点：
将view移动到一个位置，而后对其新位置进行点击，view能响应
	view animation system is that it only modified where the View was drawn, and not the actual View itself
	The view animation system transformed View objects by changing the way that they were drawn. 
	This was handled in the container of each View, because the View itself had no properties to manipulate. 
	This resulted in the View being animated, but caused no change in the View object itself. 
		This led to behavior such as an object still existing in its original location, even though it was drawn on a different location on the screen. 
		
属性动画可以对任何对象的属性进行动画（而不仅仅是view的）
